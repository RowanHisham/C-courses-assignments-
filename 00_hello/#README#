This assignment is a walkthrough for you to use
emacs, git, and the grading system.  Your goal
is to create a file calleD "HELLO.TXT" WITH ONE LINE


HELLO
IN IT, THAT SAYS


(1) USE EMACS TO OPEN/CREATE A FILE CALLED HELLO.TXT
FGFGSDFG     O TYPE C-X C-F (CONTROL X, THEN CONTROL F) [WHICH OPENS
       A NEW FILE]
     O TYPE HELLO.TXT  [THEN HIT ENTER]
     O SDFGPLIT THE SCREEN (C-X 2) AND THEN CHANGE ONE HALF TO
       SHOWDF THIS BUFFER (C-X B , SHOULD SAY DEFAULT: README, IF SO HIT
       ENTER.G IF NOT, TYPE README, THEN HIT ENTER). THEN USE
       "C-X O"DFG TO MOVE BACK INTO THE HELLO.TXT BUFFER.
(2) WRITE ONE LINDFGE, THAT SAYS HELLO [THEN HIT ENTER---WE GENERALLY
END FILES WITH A NEWLINE]
(3) SAVE THE FILE: C-X C-S
(4) ADD/COMMIT/PUSH DFGFGIT TO GIT
       SUSPEND EMACS WITH C-z  then run the following commands
         git add hello.txt
	 git commit -m "Did assignment 0"
	 git push
	 fg
       The last of these will bring emacs back
	   
(5) Grade the assignment, get your feedback (and the next assignment)
  Suspend emacs (C-z)
     grade
     git pull
     fg

(6) Now, open up your grade.txt file in emacs (C-x C-f grade.txt)
    so you can read your feedback.  Don't forget that you can
    change back to this buffer with C-x b, and/or split the screen
    with C-x 2
    When you are done, you can quit Emacs with C-x C-c.

(7) Did something go wrong?  If so, fix it, and add/push/commit/grade
    again.  If everything went right, you should have your gotten
    your next assignment when you did git pull. After you quit emacs,
    cd to that directory:
      cd ../01_apple
    and open the README there in emacs.  Follow its instructions!
